## Introduction

This is a project to port [the esviji Web puzzle game](http://esviji.com) to native apps for iOS and Android.

## Creating/updating the source webapp

The `www/` folder is generated by [the `grunt phonegap` task available in the esviji project](https://github.com/esviji/esviji/blob/master/Gruntfile.js)

The PhoneGap `config.xml` file is generated from [the source config.xml file in the esviji project](https://github.com/esviji/esviji/blob/master/src/config.xml).

## Generating the native apps binaries

Adobe's free [PhoneGap Build](https://build.phonegap.com/apps/) service is used to generate iOS and Android apps binaries:
https://build.phonegap.com/apps/1864078/builds

## Uploading the binaries to the stores

### Android

The `.apk` file downloaded from PhoneGap Build is uploaded to [Google Play Developer Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/)

### iOS

The `.ipa` file downloaded from PhoneGap Build is uploaded to [iTunes Connect](https://itunesconnect.apple.com/) with the [Application Loader](https://itunesconnect.apple.com/docs/UsingApplicationLoader.pdf) Mac OS app.
