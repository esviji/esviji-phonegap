# PhoneGap port of the esviji web game

## Introduction

This is a project to port [the esviji puzzle game](http://esviji.com) to native apps for iOS and Android.

## Source webapp creation/update

The `www/` folder is generated by [the `grunt phonegap` task available in the esviji project](https://github.com/esviji/esviji/blob/master/Gruntfile.js)

The PhoneGap `config.xml` file is generated from [the source config.xml file in the esviji project](https://github.com/esviji/esviji/blob/master/src/config.xml).

## Native apps binaries generation

Adobe's free [PhoneGap Build service](https://build.phonegap.com/apps/) is used to generate iOS and Android apps binaries:
